**Research Proposition:**

To explore and evaluate the effectiveness of an equal-weighted portfolio construction methodology as a potential stock selection strategy for generating alpha in the context of mutual funds and investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This research aims to assess whether this methodology consistently outperforms the majority of funds in terms of returns.

**Research Question:**

What is the comparative performance of an equal-weighted portfolio constructed from the top 10 securities, based on the sum of the total portfolio investment in each security for each fund during a specified period, against the investment strategies employed by a sample of mutual funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940? Can this methodology consistently generate higher alpha than the majority of these funds over the same reporting periods?

**PROCESS:**

_1. Data Collection:_
  - Retrieve historical data on the portfolio holdings of mutual funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 from the SEC.gov database, specifically from Form N-PORT filings.
  - Store this data in a local MySQL database for efficient querying and analysis using Java.

_2. Data Preparation:_
  - Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
  - Calculate the sum of the total portfolio investment in each security for each fund during the specified reporting periods.

_3. Portfolio Construction:_
  - Develop the methodology for constructing an equal-weighted portfolio based on the top 10 securities.

_4. Performance Evaluation:_
  - Analyze the performance of the equal-weighted portfolio strategy against the performance of the sample mutual funds over multiple reporting periods.
  - Measure alpha generated by each strategy.

_5. Statistical Analysis:_
  - Perform statistical tests and analyses to determine if the equal-weighted portfolio consistently outperforms the majority of funds in terms of alpha generation.

_6. Results and Interpretation:_
  - Present findings, including any statistical results.
  - Interpret the results to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the equal-weighted portfolio strategy.

_7. Discussion and Implications:_
  - Discuss the implications of findings.
  - Consider the limitations of methodology and potential areas for future research.

_9. Rinse and repeat with other strategies_
